      Throughout my childhood, I played and enjoyed a lot of games and they greatly influenced me in the future, so I really wanted to include gaming as one of my favorite things. Even though I usually play mobile games, sometimes, when I can fully appreaciate all the effort that was put into a game, it makes me really happy. The following's are a few other reasons I like gaming:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's really fun and I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I can relax and be myself while gaming.</li>
      <li>I love how gaming brings people together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I was first introduced to programming in the second semester of my first year in High School and ever since then I liked programming for it gives you freedom to create and it also makes you curious forcing to explore new things everyday. I am thankful to my school for such an amazing option because if I haven't learned about programming here, who knows if I would have been able to come across it anywhere in the future. Anyway, here are a few reasons I like programming:
      <ul>
        <li>I love creating things, and programming is a perfect option for people like me.</li>
        <li>since I like gaming, when i first heard about all the codes and others things behind the games I played, programming starting to seem really interesting to me.</li>
        <li>I like being part of the programming community.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><img src="img/sports.png" alt="sports" width="900px" /></p>
    <p> Sports have always been a passion of mine, mainly because I love physcial activities in general since I am the type of person who can't sit on the same place for a long time(ironic because I also like programming). My favorite sport is any sport, I love them all beacuse of how interestiong and unique they all can be in there own way, but if i had to chose a few specfic ones, i would probably say badminton, soccer and basketball. There are other reasons I love sports, like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Sports help you stay fit and healthy</li>
      <li>Sports are super fun</li>
      <li>Having a favorite sport gives you motivation and determination to continue getting better everyday</li>
    </ul>
